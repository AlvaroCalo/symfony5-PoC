# Symfony 5 Web Application

This is a basic web application made with Symfony 5. It includes some basic web rendering, CRUDs to a MariaDB database and basic JQuery tables.

## Technologies

For the Front-End I've used:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap template

For the Back-End I've used:
1. PHP with Symfony 5 framework
2. MariaDB

## How to test it

You have to create a database called gastrodonostia and import the file gastrodonostia.sql.
In the .env file you have to write the user and the password of the database.

Thank you
